# HW-3 MOUSA ALAKESH 200449200

This project is to design and build a REST-based web application that supports the following two services: 
1. Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication) on numbers 
2. Show list of all operations performed on the server (Date, Time, type of operation, numbers, result). The user should also be able to filter the operations by date and type. The server should save all operations in a MongoDB database. 

The application has a front-end that should be developed in React. The back-end should be developed in Node/Express. The front-end interacts with the back-end via a set of well-defined REST APIs.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`
